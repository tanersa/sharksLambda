                              CREATING COST OPTIMIZED INFRASTRUCTURE BY LEVERAGING AWS LAMBDA SERVICES

In our current infrastructure, we have two environments: **_DEV_** and **_PROD_**

**_PROD_** **_ENVIRONMENT_**: Critical Environment. We want to have zero downtime in PROD.

**_DEV_** **_ENVIRONMENT_**: Non-Critical Environment. It means we can start and stop instances.
 
Usually, we do development in DEV env. from 9 am to 6 pm.

TO DO THIS... 

**There are multiple steps to take:**

**_1- Create a new IAM role_**:
  We need to create a new role to attach our policices.
  
**_2- Create two permissions_** - One is for getting the logs in Cloudwatch and the other is to have privilege to start and stop EC2 instances.

        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                    "logs:CreateLogStream",
                    "logs:PutLogEvents"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                    "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                    "ec2:StartInstances",
                    "ec2:StopInstances",
                    "ec2:TerminateInstances"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

**_3- Create a new Lambda Function and attach the role to the Lambda function_** 

**_Start_the_instances_**

    import boto3 

    def lambda_handler(event, context):

        #Get list of regions
        ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
        regions = [region['RegionName']
                    for region in ec2_client.describe_regions()['Regions']]


        #Itirate over the regions
        for region in regions:
            ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2',region_name=region)

            print("Region:", region)


            #Get only stopped instances
            instances = ec2.instances.filter(
                Filters=[{'Name': 'instance-state-name',
                            'Values': ['stopped']}])


            #Start the instances
            for instance in instances:
                instance.start()
                print('Started instance:', instance.id)
                
 **_Stop_the_instances_**
 
    import boto3 

    def lambda_handler(event, context):

        #Get list of regions
        ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2')
        regions = [region['RegionName']
                    for region in ec2_client.describe_regions()['Regions']]


        #Itirate over the regions
        for region in regions:
            ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2',region_name=region)

            print("Region:", region)


            #Get only running instances
            instances = ec2.instances.filter(
                Filters=[{'Name': 'instance-state-name',
                            'Values': ['running']}])


            #Stop the instances
            for instance in instances:
                instance.stop()
                print('Stopped instance:', instance.id)
  
**_4- Create EC2 Instances in two different regions as US-East-1 and US-West-1_**

  - US_East_1: 3 instances
  - US_East_2: 2 instances

**_5- Go to CloudWatch and build and Event under Amazon Event Bridge_**

  In order to reach the solution, we need to trigger the Lambda function through CloudWatch.
  For that, go to Amazon Event Bridge and create a rule as **start and stop instances**. During the creation of a rule under Amazon event Bridge, we choose Lambda   function as **TARGET**
  
  After going to Cloudwatch, choose Log Groups to check if event is triggered and refresh the page.
  
  Event Logs should be visible.
  
  Then go to EC2 and check if instances get started and stopped.
  



**NOTE**

During this event triggering by CloudWatch I encountered an **issue:**

I was not able to start and stop instances multiple times then I found the issue as I need to increase the timeout in Lambda function. 

Furthermore, whenever there is an update in policy, it takes in effect immediately.
